# U.S. bikeshare data
## Overview
calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset (bikeshare data) to analyze
## Softwares needed:
* Python 3, NumPy, and Pandas. <br>
* A text editor, Pycharm or Atom.<br>
* A terminal application.<br>
## Files used:
* bikeshare_2.py
## The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:<br><br>

* Start Time<br>
* End Time<br>
* Trip Duration<br>
* Start Station<br>
* End Station<br>
* User Type<br><br>

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:<br>
* Gender<br>
* Birth Year<br>
## Answering Questions
Through writing code, I'm able to make an interactive user interface to answer the following questions about the bike share data:<br><br>

* What month occurs most often in the start time?<br>
* What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time?<br>
* What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?<br>
* What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?<br>
* What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?<br>
* What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?<br>
* What are the counts of each user type?<br>
* What are the counts of gender?<br>
* What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?<br>
* Ask user if he want to see raw data?
